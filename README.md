# Recycling-Deep-Learning-Model
With two group members, we created a deep learning model that allows users to upload a picture of their wastes, and the model recognises what king of waste it is, and then tells the user which dupster their waste should go. The code has an important data preprocessing, that allows the results to be good, and proposes different Neural Nets as models and compares them, and finally uses the best one to create the final model to create a function that will allow to classify the wastes into their correct dumpster.
